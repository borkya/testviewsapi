  title: NF Annuity Workflow V1
  description: >
    This API provides operations for searching, updating, and creating
    annuity workflow items and documents. 
    A "document" is a viewable document such as a PDF that has associated 
    index information.  A document will be associated with one or more work items.
    A "document content" is the actual raw content of the document. 
    A "Work Item" is also known as a Transaction or Request in some systems, is a
    unit of work that groups documents. A work item is used for two specific purposes
    1. A single unit of work processed in workflow
    2. A group of documents that are related and share attributes
